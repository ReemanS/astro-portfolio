# Reeman's New Portfolio

My portfolio showcasing who I am and some projects I've done. Rewritten in Astro üöÄ

My [previous portfolio website](https://reemans.vercel.app) is written using Next.js. I felt like that was a bit overkill for a mostly static portfolio and it also didn't help that I didn't know Next.js best practices when I was developing it (_everything_ was under `src/app`, honestly the source code is just embarrassing ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

So when I discovered [Astro](https://astro.build), I immediately liked it and decided to rewrite my portfolio using this meta-framework after doing some practice projects. It might be the sweet spot between the complex Next.js tool system and just plain vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript.
