# Reeman's New Portfolio

My [current portfolio website](https://www.reemans.xyz) is written using Next.js. I am going to challenge myself by rewriting it in Astro.

Of course I'll still be implementing it with React since that's what I already know lol

### Why use Astro?

As I've read more about Astro, I feel like it's exactly the right tool for a mostly static portfolio. It might be the sweet spot between the complex Next.js tool system and just plain vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript. I didn't really leverage most of Next.js features, so I'll switch it up a bit here try to use more of Astro's features.
