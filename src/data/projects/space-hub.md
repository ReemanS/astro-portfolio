Space is fascinating. NASA's APIs are awesome.

Space Hub is a Flutter web application that makes NASA's data accessible and engaging. With this simple app, you can:

- View the Astronomy Picture of the Day
- View the latest natural color image of the Earth, famously known as the "Blue Marble"

I created this using Flutter and deployed it to the web.

If you look at the GitHub repository, you'll notice that it is the build output of Flutter and not the source code itself ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (To be fair I didn't know much when I pushed this). One day, I'll get to _actually_ uploading the actual source code üòÅ
