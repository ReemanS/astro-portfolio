Ever wanted to have a conversation with an AI that actually knows its geography? That's what I built with Pinpoint!

This was more of an exploratory project for me to try out both the Mapbox and OpenAI APIs. I wanted to create something specialized that could answer questions about countries, capitals, landmarks, and even help visualize locations on a map.

Built using Next.js, Pinpoint features a chat interface where users can ask geography-related questions. I made the language model specifically give responses on geographic data and wired it up with Mapbox to redirect you to where the place is on the globe.

This was my first dive into creating a domain-specific AI assistant, and it taught me tons about prompt engineering and context handling. As of writing this, the project is still WIP. Expect new features soon!
