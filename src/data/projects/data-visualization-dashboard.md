Content collections are stored outside of the src/pages/ directory. This means that no pages or routes are generated for your collection items by default.

You will need to manually create a new dynamic route if you want to generate HTML pages for each of your collection entries, such as individual blog posts. Your dynamic route will map the incoming request param (e.g. Astro.params.slug in `src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro)` to fetch the correct entry for each page.

List of stuff:

- thing 1
- thing 2 that is **more important**
- thing 3 _italian_

The exact method for generating routes will depend on whether your pages are prerendered (default) or rendered on demand by a server.

Code:

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require("./lang/" + l);
  return true;
};
```
