Demark is an exploratory markdown-to-HTML parser I made when I was learning about the interactions between Markdown and regular HTML.

This lightweight markdown parser was designed specifically for React and Next.js projects where you just need basic markdown functionality without the overhead of larger libraries. The goal was to create something that "just works" while keeping the bundle size minimal.

While not exactly production-ready, I feel like it is a neat little helper that could be used in very ultra-specific circumstances.
