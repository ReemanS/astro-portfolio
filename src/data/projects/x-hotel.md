X-Hotel was my team's answer to creating a simulated hotel booking system for our System Integration and Architecture course. üè®

The frontend was built with TypeScript and React, focusing on creating an intuitive booking experience. Users could easily filter by amenities, view high-quality images, and understand the pricing. The data was stored on Firebase (Specifically their Realtime Database), which made it somewhat reactive to real-time changes.

I'd say that this was my first actual Next.js project, and I've learned a lot since then.
